Author: Kejie SHAO

## Usage
`mkdir bin obj mod` and `make`. 

## Input file

    # Number of atoms
    6
    # Labels of atoms
    A A B B B B 
    # degree and number of exit point
    3 1
    # exit index of FI
    1

An example below. 

Note that the number of exit point in the third input line (#6). If `3` was typed, there must be three numbers in the last line. 

Actually I doesn't understand the meaning of exit point. Please check your input for your self. I format the code only.
